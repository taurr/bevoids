## Installation

Currently theres no easy way of installing the game ðŸ˜¢

However, clone the repo and run the game using:

```shell
cargo run --release -- --assets $PWD/bevoids_game/assets
```

Should work on both Linux and Windows, though you'd need to adjust the `--assets` argument.

If `--assets` is not specified, the game will attempt to read from `$PWD/assets` by default.
